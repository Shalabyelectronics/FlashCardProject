# Flashcard technique
![](readme_img\readme_gui.png)
## Introduction:
#### This small application is a Python tkinter library practice as I designed and functioned a flashcard learning technique to learn english from the most frequency list, and I used it [from hermitdave project](https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords).
#### The project will show the english word firs then after three seconds will show the translated word in arabic so if user know this word will click yes so this particular word will be removed from the data file, else if user do not know about this word will click NO button.
#### Finally, if user want to save his progress and exit will click Save and Exit button.
